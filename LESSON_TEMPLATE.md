# [Lesson Title]

> [One-line motto — the core idea that sticks]

**Type:** Build | Learn
**Languages:** Python, TypeScript, Rust, Julia (list what's used)
**Prerequisites:** [List prior lessons needed]
**Time:** ~[estimated time] minutes

## The Problem

[2-3 paragraphs. What can't you do without this? Why should you care?
Make it concrete — show a scenario where not knowing this hurts.]

## The Concept

[Explain with diagrams and intuition. No code yet.
Use ASCII diagrams, tables, or link to visuals in the web app.
Build mental models before implementation.]

## Build It

[Step-by-step implementation from scratch.
Start with the simplest version, then add complexity.
Every code block should be runnable on its own.]

### Step 1: [Name]

[Explanation]

    [code block]

### Step 2: [Name]

[Explanation]

    [code block]

[...continue...]

## Use It

[Now show how frameworks/libraries do the same thing.
Compare your from-scratch version to the library version.
This proves the concept and introduces practical tools.]

## Ship It

[What reusable artifact does this lesson produce?
Could be a prompt, a skill, an agent, an MCP server, or a tool.
Include it here and save it in the outputs/ folder.]

## Exercises

1. [Easy — reinforce the core concept]
2. [Medium — apply it to a different problem]
3. [Hard — extend or combine with prior lessons]

## Key Terms

| Term | What people say | What it actually means |

| [term] | [common misconception] | [actual definition] |

## Code File Guidelines
代码文件指南

- Code must run without errors --- 代码必须能够无错误运行
- No comments — code should be self-explanatory --- 不要添加注释——代码应当自解释
- Use the language that fits best for the topic --- 使用最适合该主题的语言
- Include a `requirements.txt` or equivalent if there are dependencies --- 如果有依赖项，请包含 `requirements.txt` 或等效文件
- Start simple, build up complexity --- 从简单开始，逐步增加复杂度
- Every function and class should have a clear purpose --- 每个函数和类都应有明确的用途
